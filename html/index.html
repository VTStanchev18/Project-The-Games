        <p class="text"> Here you can find our game that is about history. We hope that more people
            will start to like history by playing our game. The game is very simple. 
            There are 12 squares on the screen with pictures of famous Bulgarian rulers (6 pairs).
            You need to flip them and if you get 2 pictures that are identical, you get a point.
            If you have questions, please go to the feedback page.</p>
